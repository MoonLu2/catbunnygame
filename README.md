# What's "catbunnygame"?

Cat Bunny Game - is the first videogame made by me and someone else who was helping me... :3

### What's that code?

if you would look closely into the code of the game, you'll notice that it's written in GDscript and the game was made in the Godot Engine (who expected somebody with almost no experience to code a new engine for his/her game?).
